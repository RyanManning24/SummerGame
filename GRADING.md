# Planning and Documentation
- [x] UML diagram present
- [x] Algorithmic discussion of trajectory 

# Gameplay 

#### Basic Requirements: At Good Standard
- [ ] Introductory screen with instructions
- [x] Birds and Pigs rendered and positioned correctly
- [ ] Click and drag support
- [ ] Bird fires using player's origin
- [ ] Bird registers collisions with Pigs
- [ ] Scoring system
- [ ] Win and Lose states with replay options

#### Extended Functionality
- [ ] Working extensions to the base requirements  
**Notes:**

# Implementation
- [ ] Correct use of the coding standard
- [ ] No memory leaks present
- [ ] Well structured and easy to follow
- [ ] Good use of object orientated design
- [ ] Static Checks (within reason)

# Marking

#### Breakdown of Components
Shown below are the weighting for each component being assessed. 

| Component                                        | %       |
| -------------------------------------------------|:-------:|
| Problem Analysis (UML, Pseudo-code & Flow-Chart) |   10%   |
| Playability & Innovation                         |   45%   |
| Technical Implementation                         |   45%   |
| ------                                           | ------- |
| **Total**                                        |**100%** | 

The three components total 100%. 
This assignment contributes **50%** of your portfolio mark.

#### Additional Feedback
> Where's the comparison between before and after UML? Also classes are objects, which in themselves are nouns not plural. Arrays are collections of these nouns and thus plural. 
>
> Could only get the first level to render but no game-play was possible. The code-base was very basic, ignored the coding standards and was difficult to reason. I would concentrate on your basic coding skills and simple programming paradigm's going forward.
